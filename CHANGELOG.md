### Technical Implementation
- Modular architecture with separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Memory-safe operations with automatic cleanup
- Configuration management with sensible defaults
- Easily extensible for future enhancements

### Dependencies
- `cryptography` ^41.0.0 - Encryption and cryptographic operations
- `pyotp` ^2.9.0 - Time-based one-time password generation
- `qrcode[pil]` ^7.4.2 - QR code generation
- `rich` ^13.7.0 - Enhanced terminal user interface
- `pillow` ^10.0.0 - Image processing for QR code handling
- *(Optional)* `opencv-python` - Webcam QR scanning
- *(Optional)* `pyzbar` - QR code decoding

### Known Issues
- File upload dialog may not open on some systems without GUI libraries
- QR code scanning via webcam may fail on systems with camera access restrictions or missing codecs
- Some antivirus software may flag encrypted vault files as suspicious (false positive)

### Security Notes
- All cryptographic operations use industry-standard implementations
- No network communication â€” completely offline operation
- Vault data is encrypted at rest using strong encryption standards
- Master password is never stored in plaintext
